To install an IDE for Visual Basic .Net and C# desktop development and start developing files, the recommended approach is to install Microsoft Visual Studio with the .NET Desktop Development workload.

### Steps to Install Visual Studio for Visual Basic .Net and C# Desktop Development:
1. Download Visual Studio from the official Microsoft site. The Community edition is free and sufficient for most desktop development needs.
2. During installation, select the ".NET Desktop Development" workload. This provides the necessary tools, SDKs, and project templates for both Visual Basic and C# desktop applications including Windows Forms and WPF.
3. Complete the installation and launch Visual Studio.
4. To create a desktop app, choose "Create a new project," then filter by language (Visual Basic or C#) and project type (Desktop, Windows Forms App, WPF, etc.).
5. Configure the project details and start coding. Visual Studio also includes designers for building user interfaces visually.

This setup supports developing both Visual Basic .Net and C# desktop applications effectively. You can create Windows Forms, WPF apps, or even console applications with this environment.[1][2][3][4][5]
