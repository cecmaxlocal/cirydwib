Dell machines come with software that is governed by various license agreements, typically an End User License Agreement (EULA). Key points about licensing for Dell machines include:

- Software included on Dell hardware, such as pre-installed Dell-branded software or system software (firmware, BIOS), is licensed for use on that specific hardware and may have restrictions against transferring, modifying, or reverse engineering.
- Licenses can be perpetual (use software indefinitely under terms) or term-based (subscription with a limited period).
- Dell's EULA prohibits unauthorized copying, renting, leasing, sublicensing, or distribution of software, and limits the use to the hardware it was intended for.
- Users must comply with export control laws and other regulatory requirements when using Dell software.
- Dell also offers community edition licenses for certain software with separate terms, typically provided "as is" without warranties.
- The full terms and conditions, including warranties and limitations of liability, are detailed in the license agreements Dell provides, often accessible via Dell's official legal and support websites.

For specifics, Dell provides documents covering license terms for software on their machines, including subscription and community editions.[1][2][3][4]
