The license for Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition allows individual developers to use it for creating both free and paid applications. Organizations can use it under certain conditions: up to five users in a non-enterprise organization, and unlimited users only for classroom learning, academic research, or open-source projects. Use in enterprise organizations (more than 250 PCs or $1 million USD in revenue) is generally restricted except for specific development scenarios like open source, education, or device drivers.

In summary:
- Individuals can freely use Visual Studio Community for any development, including commercial use.
- Non-enterprise organizations can use it with up to five users.
- Enterprise organizations face significant restrictions, and the Pro or Enterprise editions may be required.
- The license terms also cover usage rights and limitations in detail.

This means for most individual and small team development scenarios, Visual Studio Community is fully permitted to develop and sell software.[1][4][5]
