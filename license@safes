Licenses related to safes, especially safe deposit boxes, typically refer to agreements granting access and use rights. Key points about safe deposit box licenses include:

- Licensees are authorized individuals who can access and administrate the safe deposit box; mandatees have access rights but limited administrative rights.
- Registration requires identification and presence of licensees and mandatees.
- Access to the box requires identity verification by the service provider.
- License agreements clarify that the service provider holds the box but not the contents in a trustee capacity.
- There are rules for opening the box, especially if the lessee cannot be present, including legal procedures for handling unclaimed contents.
- Safe deposit companies may need specific business licenses and certifications depending on jurisdiction.
- Customers must comply with the terms set by the service provider, which include usage, access control, and liability limitations.

These agreements are usually formalized in a "Safe Deposit Box License Agreement" or similar documents provided by banks or safe deposit service providers.[1][2][3][4][6]
